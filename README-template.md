### Useful resources

- [Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me with doubts I had about Css and Javascript while building my project.

- [Web3schools](https://w3schools.com/) - I used this website to learn about animations in css. I learned about keyframes and how to implement them into my project.
